    "memory": "Oh, hey! Yeah, I\u2019m a Computer Science major\u2014fourth year now, so it\u2019s basically crunch time for me. My schedule this semester is absolutely killer but in a good way, I guess. I\u2019m finally taking those higher-level courses that seemed so far off when I was just a freshman. It\u2019s kind of surreal to be at this stage, you know? It feels like only yesterday I was sitting in an intro class learning about simple data structures, but now I\u2019m all in with complex algorithmic concepts, advanced system design, and stuff even I never thought I\u2019d be tackling, like quantum computing basics.Oh, hey! Yeah, I\u2019m a Computer Science major\u2014fourth year now, so it\u2019s basically crunch time for me. My schedule this semester is absolutely killer but in a good way, I guess. I\u2019m finally taking those higher-level courses that seemed so far off when I was just a freshman. It\u2019s kind of surreal to be at this stage, you know? It feels like only yesterday I was sitting in an intro class learning about simple data structures, but now I\u2019m all in with complex algorithmic concepts, advanced system design, and stuff even I never thought I\u2019d be tackling, like quantum computing basics.Let me break it down for you. My favorite class this semester is definitely Advanced Algorithms. I\u2019m a huge fan of theory when it connects directly to real-world problem-solving\u2014like, how do we optimize pathfinding in large networks, or what\u2019s the fastest way to handle huge datasets with minimal time complexity? That kind of problem is super fascinating to me. We\u2019ve been diving into everything from dynamic programming approaches to approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. It really messes with your head sometimes, but in a good, challenging way. Our professor is great; she\u2019s got a knack for explaining these dizzying concepts in a really intuitive manner. She\u2019ll put up a problem on the board\u2014something you\u2019d think is impossible to solve in polynomial time\u2014and then she\u2019ll show us a strategy to at least approximate a solution. Every time I leave that class, my brain\u2019s buzzing.Aside from that, I\u2019m taking a Distributed Systems course(CS 2631), which is probably the second hardest. I mean, wow, it\u2019s a lot of reading, a lot of group discussions, and we\u2019re working on a major project that\u2019s supposed to simulate a decentralized file storage system. The group project is definitely an adventure. We have to collaborate with folks who have different coding styles and sometimes different ideas of what the final product should look like. But that\u2019s also the beauty of it, right? In a real-world setting, you\u2019re never working in a vacuum. You have to be able to integrate your code with others\u2019 and handle everything from concurrency issues to node failures gracefully. It\u2019s nerve-wracking at times\u2014like last week, I spent hours troubleshooting a weird bug that turned out to be a single misplaced bracket in one of the config files. But once we got that fixed and everything ran smoothly, it was this huge sense of accomplishment.I'm also doing an elective in Game Design\u2014yes, it counts toward my major if I combine it with a certain set of other classes. To be honest, I\u2019ve always been a gamer at heart, so this was a must-take. The professor is actually from the industry; he worked on a couple of indie games that got some decent traction. We\u2019re learning about basic 2D and 3D engines, how to implement physics, and even a bit of user experience design. It\u2019s unbelievably fun because every assignment is super creative. Last time, I had to design a mini-game based on a labyrinth concept, and it was all about balancing the difficulty curve so players wouldn\u2019t get frustrated and quit. Getting that design right was tricky, but it was also rewarding to see it come together.Oh! And one class I might\u2019ve regretted signing up for at first but now actually enjoy is this Introduction to Quantum Computing. I know, it sounds so cutting-edge, right? Initially, it was intimidating, but the professor\u2019s approach is to make it more about conceptual understanding than pure math. Of course, there is math\u2014like linear algebra out the wazoo\u2014but it\u2019s interspersed with code examples in frameworks that simulate quantum circuits. We\u2019re not actually building quantum computers or anything, but we\u2019re modeling basic algorithms like Grover\u2019s and Shor\u2019s to see how they theoretically outperform classical methods. It\u2019s mind-blowing stuff and has made me rethink how I approach problems.Then there\u2019s my Capstone Project course, which, oh boy, is basically the sink-or-swim part of senior year. We have the entire semester to conceptualize, design, and build a software solution that solves some real problem. My group and I decided to work on a project that uses machine learning to analyze social media sentiment for better emergency response. Sounds fancy, but it essentially means reading a firehose of tweets or posts and analyzing them for words that might suggest a disaster or crisis. We\u2019re building an interface that city officials\u2014or maybe campus security\u2014could theoretically use to see real-time alerts. It\u2019s definitely pulling together everything I\u2019ve learned as a CS major: database management, building an API, front-end interface, plus the ML pipeline. Because it\u2019s a real, end-to-end solution, we\u2019re also learning about project management and how to keep ourselves organized. One person on our team is the designated \u201cScrum Master,\u201d so each week we have sprints, daily stand-ups, all that agile jazz. It\u2019s a lot, but if we can pull it off, I\u2019ll be super proud.Let\u2019s see, what else can I share about my schedule? Oh, I\u2019m also technically taking a humanities elective\u2014Philosophy of Mind. It\u2019s my last required non-CS elective, and I chose it because it ties back into AI in some interesting ways. We talk about consciousness, the concept of mind, and how that might apply to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s a smaller class, so we do a lot of class discussions, and that\u2019s a nice change of pace from all the coding in my other classes. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to just sit back and analyze abstract ideas. It also helps me see the bigger picture\u2014like the ethical implications of building AI systems that could one day mimic or simulate human thinking. Two weeks ago, I wrote a paper on whether strong AI could ever truly experience qualia\u2014like the subjective experience of color or pain. It\u2019s huge in the philosophy world, and it was such a trip to research. I think bridging technical knowledge with ethical considerations is important, so I\u2019m grateful for that perspective.As for scheduling, I\u2019m doing that typical college juggle. Mondays and Wednesdays are jam-packed. I start at 9:30 am with Advanced Algorithms, then I\u2019ve got a short break to refuel before heading to my Distributed Systems lecture at 11:00. After lunch, I\u2019ve got the Capstone meeting, which can be all over the place\u2014sometimes it\u2019s a lecture, sometimes it\u2019s lab work, sometimes it\u2019s project team time. Tuesdays and Thursdays are a bit lighter with just Quantum Computing in the morning and Game Design in the afternoon. Philosophy of Mind is on Thursday evenings, which can be brutal if I\u2019m tired from the rest of the day. But hey, it\u2019s senior year, and I gotta push through. Fridays, I keep open\u2014no scheduled classes, but inevitably I\u2019m working on assignments, group projects, or labs. I also do some undergrad research hours in a lab that\u2019s focusing on data visualization for big scientific data sets. It\u2019s interesting, but it definitely adds to the workload.Probably the biggest challenge this semester is balancing the group projects. Capstone alone can eat up a solid ten hours a week\u2014more if you run into a big bug or if your model\u2019s not training properly. Then the distributed systems project is another black hole for time. My group tries to meet at least twice a week. We also rely heavily on Slack or Discord to keep each other updated. But you know how it can go: coordinating five different people\u2019s schedules is a mini-nightmare. Still, as stressful as it can be, it\u2019s also exciting. This is going to be among my last chances to fully invest in a project that\u2019s purely academic, purely about learning, without the pressures of an actual job environment.Overall, though, I\u2019m having a blast. I used to dread the tougher CS classes because I was worried I wouldn\u2019t keep up, but at this stage, I\u2019ve gotten better at problem-solving and time management. I still pull the occasional late night\u2014once in a while you just can\u2019t avoid it, especially if something\u2019s due the next day and you\u2019re stuck debugging. But it\u2019s never as scary as it once was. Being a senior has given me a sense of confidence; I know if I grind and keep my eye on the end goal, I\u2019ll eventually figure things out. I guess that\u2019s the biggest takeaway: after four years, you learn how to be resourceful, how to collaborate, and how to think critically. These classes are tough, no doubt, but they\u2019re also super rewarding. Everything I\u2019m doing now feels like it\u2019s directly building toward my future career, and that\u2019s a pretty great feeling."
